<h3>My favourite player
  <p>Kawhi leonard is my favourite player because he is the one who made the difference for
     the raptors in the 2019-20 Nba season. Before he came the raptors where strugling to
      find that key player with that big dog mentality.
     <hr> Yes the raptors made it past stages of the playoffs 
    but rarely any more than that. Also Kawhi Leonard was known as a notouriously good player; But he just
  recovered from a major injury (from an out of bounds fall) then he came to toronto wining finals and 
  season mvp, while getting his first ring. He brought the raptors there first franchise NBA championship.
He pulled a clutch 2 point fade-away to win the 7th game of the confrence finals to take them to the
